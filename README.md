# Findify Search, Recommendations and Smart Collections.

Here you can find the complete set of documentation of all our solutions. The documentations is structured based on the phase of the integration, and divided by platforms, for ease of navigation. If you have any questions, thoughts, comments or issues, please contact us at __yourfriends@findify.io__

## Getting started

We have developed apps for the following e-commerce platforms: [Shopify](https://apps.shopify.com/findify-search), [BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/findify-search-recommendations) and [Magento](https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/findify-search-autocomplete.html) These extensions enable a quick and simple integration with Findify. If you are not on any of these platforms, don't worry! The solution can be integrated with any platform, just follow the "Custom integration" instructions.

Start by selecting your platform, or "custom":

- [Shopify](onboarding/shopify/README.md)
- [BigCommerce](onboarding/bigcommerce/README.md)
- [Magento](onboarding/magento/README.md)
- [Custom](onboarding/custom/README.md)

## Integration
After installing one of our apps, or completing the initial setup tasks for the custom integration, there are a few additional steps required to set everything live:

- [Shopify Private App](onboarding/shopify/integration.md)
- [BigCommerce](onboarding/bigcommerce/integration.md)
- [Magento](onboarding/magento/Integration.md)
- [Custom](onboarding/custom/integration.md)

## Advanced usage

Now that you've set Findify live on your store, you can enhance the experience of your customers even further!
Check out the documentation of our Merchant.JS API, which allows you to make advanced modifications to all the frontend components. 

### [Merchant.JS API](merchant-js/README.md)

The [Merchant JS](merchant-js/README.md) is a JavaScript library that is included in your store and provides the intregration with all the functionality we expose, as well as all customizations that you can do through the Merchant Dashboard. 
The [Merchant JS](merchant-js/README.md) also exposes an API with the help of which you can perform different modifications both to the UI and to the content.

We have also created a few [examples](merchant-js/examples/README.md) that demostrate how you can use the M.JS API.

### Search API
All of Findify's functionality is exposed via a JSON API. Some Beta functionality is only exposed via the API, and you're welcome to try them out:
