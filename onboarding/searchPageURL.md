## Search page URL

The search page URL, is the page to which your customers will be redirected to view the search results. Itâ€™s best to create a dedicated, empty page in your store.
Once you've created the search page URL, use it in the onboarding flow, or share it with your integration contact at Findify.

Examples of search page locations:

* */search*
* */pages/search*
* */pages/search/results*
