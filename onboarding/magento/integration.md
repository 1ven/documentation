# Findify Magento Integration

__Important note: you would need to install and set up [Magento Plugin](https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/findify-search-autocomplete.html) to finish integration__

To integrate Findify into your shop you'll need to follow steps listed below:

* Create an account in our system
* Provide more information about your shop
* Provide a valid product feed that was generated by [Magento Plugin](https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/findify-search-autocomplete.html)
* Paste the link to JavaScript file to the [Magento Plugin](https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/findify-search-autocomplete.html)

## Create an account in our system

1. Go to our [Registration Page](https://dashboard.findify.io/#/sign-in/register)
2. Select _Magento_
3. Enter you name, email and store url. The store url value should not contain _https://_ or _http://_ prefix, e.g. __www.mystore.com__ or __mystore.com__ are both valid
4. You wil receive an email to validate your account. Click the confirmation link and proceed to next steps

## Provide more information about your shop

1. Select feed language

__This is an important step as we analyze your feed using a specific analyzer for each language  and frontend will be translated accordingly. If you don't find the language you need, conctact us at youfriends@findify.io__
2. Choose the timzone that your shop is in. This is mainly for analytics to be calculated correctly.
3. Choose the currency of your store

__We don't support multiple currencies for the same store at the moment, unless you can do the conversion in the frontend. If you need multiple currencies, you would need to do installation for each currency and provide the feed with that currency.__

## Provide a valid product feed

The product feed generation is done by the [Magento Plugin](https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/findify-search-autocomplete.html). 

As soon as you install it and set it up you will have a link to the feed, which you will need to paste in the input for this step.

## Paste the link to JavaScript file

In the last step of the onboarding you will be presented with the link for JavaScript file that you will need to include in the [Magento Plugin](https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/findify-search-autocomplete.html)

__Findify should be live in your store now!__
