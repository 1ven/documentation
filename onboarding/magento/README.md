# Findify Magento Integration

The Magento integration consists of two parts:
* Installing and setting up [Magento Plugin](https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/findify-search-autocomplete.html)
* Registering your account with [Findify](https://dashboard.findify.io/#/sign-in/register)

You can do this steps separately or one by one, there is no particular order.
