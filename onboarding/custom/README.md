# Findify Custom Integration

It is possible to integrate Findify with __any__ platform or custom solution. The most important part in this integration is generating  the product feed which can be publicly accessible by our servers. 

_We also support Basic Authentication, but to use it please contact us at yourfriends@findify.io_

At the moment we support these formats for the product feed:

- [CSV](/productFeedCSV.md)
- [XML](/productFeedXML.md)
- JSON (_please contact us at yourfriends@findify.io directly_)

After product feed generation you can test if it's valid in our system by following the onboarding steps. If for some reason your feed cannot be validated, don't hesitate to contact us at yourfriends@findify.io.

### Next step: Follow [integration steps](/integration.md)
