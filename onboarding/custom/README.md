# Findify Custom Integration

It is possible to integrate Findify with __any__ platform or custom solution. The most important part in this integration is generating  the product feed which can be publicly accessible by our servers. 

_We also support Basic Authentication, to use it please contact us at yourfriends@findify.io_

At the moment we support these formats for the product feed:

- [CSV](productFeedCSV.md)
- [XML](productFeedXML.md)
- JSON (_please contact us at yourfriends@findify.io for details_)

After you've generated your product feed, you can validate it by following the onboarding steps. If for some reason your feed cannot be validated, don't hesitate to contact us at yourfriends@findify.io.

### Next step: Follow the [integration steps](integration.md)
